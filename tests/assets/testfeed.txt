		<itunes:summary>Most of today's show is a rebroadcast of 2008's Christmas special.nbsp; Today we pause and take a moment to reflect on Christmas and how it has become the Holiday we celebrate today.nbsp; Many Americanrsquo;s have no idea just how Christmas became unique here in America, the role it played in bringing our nation together after two wars of independence and the civil war.

Christmas is special and a time to pause and reflect.nbsp; Christmas is indeed a special time of year, today I will cover many aspects of it that may make this Christmas just a bit more special.nbsp; There is also a full text transcription on of the non commericial portion of todays show in the show notes below.

Tune in today to hear abouthellip;

	Christmas was banned in England at one time and even parts of America
	Early Americans didnrsquo;t really celebrate Christmas, (congress was in session on Dec 25th, 1789)
	In the early 1800s Christmas was a rowdy holiday spurred by class conflict, turmoil and unemployment
	In 1819, best-selling author Washington Irving wrote The Sketchbook of Geoffrey Crayon bringing us many ldquo;ancient customsrdquo;, he simply invented
	Leading up to the Civil War, Christmas was a ldquo;southern holidayrdquo; and Thanksgiving a ldquo;northern holidayrdquo;
	How Christmas and Thanksgiving together helped to heal a young America
	Today is a time to pause, reflect and just be, prepping, planning and stress will all wait patiently for you
	Different ending music for todayrsquo;s show!nbsp; The most beautiful version of Oh Holly Night I have ever heard, just pause, listen and realize what really matters while it plays.

		<itunes:summary>Today I am at home and wanted to take the opportunity to do another listener feedback episode.nbsp; We discuss some political things today like China's role in global government and the new health care bill that just came out of the senate.nbsp; We also discuss some more traditional topics like firearms selection and training, using swales for permaculture and we even get to read another "hate email" to me.

We also make a few announcements today that include our awesome new survival forum theme designed by SisterWolf who is also one of the forces behind the TSP Gear Shop.

Join me today as we discuss...

	Why are thing like tax increases and public funding of abortion in the health care bill
	Why some form of this bill is going to be passed even though most Americans don't want it
	The sob story we are going to hear from Blue Dogs and RINOs about the eventual compromise
	The one hope we really still have to prevent national health care, it isn't in the House and Senate
	What is a swale, how does it work, why do you want them
	How do you create swales in flat desert land
	Is TSP now "all about the money"
	Why growing your own food is a path to freedom
	Why the modern survival community is feared by many, be proud of it folks
	Thoughts on choosing a first gun, getting training, etc

		<itunes:summary>Join me today as we discuss 7 pieces of career, lifestyle and financial advice that most people simply assume is good advice because "everybody says so".nbsp; Much of this advice isn't exactly wrong, it just doesn't work in the one size fits all way it is handed out by the semi informed and countless marketing efforts.

Join in today as we discuss advice such as...

	Due to inflation and wage increases debtors do better then savers
	Wealthy people lease cars instead of buying them, you should too
	Going to college is for everyone and guarantees better earnings then not going
	Once you have a 90 day cash fund put all other savings into a retirement account
	Buying mutual funds diversifies your investments by investing in many companies and mutual funds are run by experts who actively act to maximize profits and reduce risk
	Due to __________ put all your money into ___________
	Find the job that pays the highest wage you can get

Join me today as we discuss a few of them such as

	Find your why first
	Follow your passion
	Use your way and passion to find your what
	In the middle of a recession a guy will buy a 800 dollar surf board and then turn off extra lights to save money
	Do NOT pay attention to what other people are selling BEFORE you find your why, your passion and what
	You must know and I mean know the answer to "who do I serve"
	You can't sell to the ignorant or the poor
	Always sell what people want, don't bother with what they "need"
	Give a shit about your customers (listening is bullshit you have to care)
	Know what ARPU and VPV are, with out them you are screwed
	How you price items, how you know your price is right
	Why no one stole your idea, that is a bullshit cop out
	As a small business you should create markets not capture market share
	You don't set your price your market does
	If you know what a visitor is worth you can't loose money

		<itunes:summary>Today we do a bit of a mixed bag and then bring them together in the end.nbsp; Today as I broadcast from my home office with better audio I am watching a Texas snow fall so it is logical to talk about global warming for a bit.nbsp; The reason I am doing so is as usual when I mention it even in passing I get a lot of "hate mail" calling me things like "holocaust denier", etc.nbsp;nbsp; I wanted to go on record as the real environmentalist that I actually am, even though I believe man made global warming due to CO2 is a complete scam.

Oh and for those in love with all those "conclusive graphs" that prove global warming.nbsp; First a graph proves nothing, it is nothing but a graphical representation of number.nbsp; So tune in today and I will explain how to manipulate a graph with out even fudging any of the numbers.nbsp; This is a technique used by all sales and marketing people, everyday.nbsp; I will also tell you about one thing we have learned from climate gate about how they fix problems with graphs just by "adding to the numbers".nbsp; Deception takes many forms, my goal today is to empower you to spot it, not to tell you what you should believe.

I then shift gears into a discussion about the two part concepts of disaster probability and disaster commonality and how they relate to each other and how those concepts can be used to improve your personal planning.

In the end I explain how these two topics are hugely linked in reality and why understanding deception, dependence and sustainability are so important to not just our physical survival but the survival of our nation and our family unit.

Tune in today to hear...

	I have found our group of soldiers to sponsor for Christmas this year
	Why much of what we learn about Thanksgiving is wrong or at least inaccurate
	How Thanksgiving was at one time considered a "damn yankee holiday"
	How Thanksgiving became a way for our nation to heal and reunite
	How the date of Thanksgiving has often been moved around and why
	The truth about those big buckles the pilgrims wore and all that black clothing
	What feasting meant 100 years ago to our prior generation that we have forgotten

	How private property in America was seen vs. the feudal system that was in place in much of the world all the way up to and in some cases past 1900
	It was land that brought early settlers to America
	Why land is the real "store of value" for all time far more so then gold, etc.
	The attack on land ownership and why governments love cities and suburbs
	The Ag Zoning trap and how it kills small farms and creates mega commerical farming that destroys land
	Why you should own land out of the city limits and own more then one piece
	The value of livestock even just a few smaller animals
	What owning your lands production means
	How to use land to build a local barter economy
	Bartering production for skills and learning skills so we don't loose them to the ravages of time
	Learning to do more with smaller tracts of land to truly beat the system
	How to make it happen and become a land owner

WARNING - You alone are responsible for any items you consume, you must be sure of species identification, if you have any doubt, donrsquo;t put it in your body.nbsp; Always start with small does and slowly gauge what happens as you increase it.nbsp; While the plants here are easy to identify there are plants out there that can and do kill people.nbsp; Again use caution, be certain of identification and I take no responsibility for anyone who chooses to not follow this piece of advice.

I used last years audio only because it said all that needed to be said.nbsp; To all vets out there that listen to TSP this show is especially for you, thank you for your service and thank you for the honor you so clearly demonstrate.nbsp; Thank you also for listening to TSP, that indeed is an honor for me to know how many vets out there find TSP worth taking time to listen to.

		<itunes:summary>So if the SHTF in most instances you plan to bug in, you have your generator, you have your food, you have a means of defense and you are prepared for whatever may come, or are you.nbsp; Today we step back a bit from the obvious and from some common thinking that isn't very realistic to examine how prepared we are for bugging in.nbsp; Please note even if you "bug out" you are going to another location and once you get there, guess what you are going to be doing, bugging in of course.

Join in today as we discuss...

	Two new eBooks free for Support Brigade Members
	Storing food for everyone possibly even some for neighbors and definitely for your pets and stock
	The need for personal hygiene products, bigger then you might think it is
	Back up power sources both short and long term
	The advantages and failings of generators
	Why you need to plan to keep the garden growing
	The need for and functionality of "security protocols" including during increased threat periods
	Why you need to quickly contact all family/close friends at the beginning of a SHTF especially if you are bugging in
	The importance of taking an inventory and sorting into needs, good to have and don't need it at all
	How inventory and sorting will help you in barter situations
	Keeping communications up as long as possible including radio, TV, Ham, MURS, etc.
	The importance of maintaining a sense of normalcy during a bug in
	How drills are about more then finding weaknesses, they are also about acclamation

		<itunes:summary>It is Monday and we are back with another round of listener questions.nbsp;nbsp; Some great ones today on topics like dealing with livestock during a SHTF, a complex real estate problem, basements in Texas, building home grown generators, operational security and spreading prepping and self sufficiency to your friends, family and acquaintances.

Tune in today to hear answers to the following questions...

	What do you do with live stock if you have to bug out and how do you prep to care for them if you bug in?
	Where and how do you store extra propane tanks?
	What is a spot price, how high above spot is reasonable to pay for silver coins?
	What about platinum and palladium as alternatives to gold for investing?
	How to handle a complex real estate situation where the owner wants to sell the land but continue to live in the house?
	Whats up with the new iPod nano, is it worth the upgrade?
	Are plans on how to build a generator from old parts a good investment/idea?
	Why are there no basements in the Texas Hill Country, if you want one what are some alternatives when building a new home?
	Why am I personally so loose on OPSEC, what advice do I have for others as to OPSEC (operational security)
	How can you open minds about prepping in 60 seconds?

		<itunes:summary>Today is the first in a multi-part series on medicinal plants, trees and herbs.nbsp; Today we start with 8 plants and trees that are very easy to identify, native to North America, grow prevalently in the wild and have multiple uses for each plant.

WARNING - You alone are responsible for any items you consume, you must be sure of species identification, if you have any doubt, don't put it in your body.nbsp; Always start with small does and slowly gauge what happens as you increase it.nbsp; While the plants here are easy to identify there are plants out there that can and do kill people.nbsp; Again use caution, be certain of identification and I take no responsibility for anyone who chooses to not follow this piece of advice.

Tune in today as we discuss these 8 North American Native Medicinal Plants...

	American Mountain Ash

		<itunes:summary>Well I still have country living on the brain after our recent trip to our BOL and soon to be primary residence in Arkansas.nbsp; I have also gotten a tremendous number of requests lately to evaluate property listings as potential BOLs, retreats and homesteads.nbsp; It is honestly almost impossible to really know a property from just a listing, they are simply starting points.nbsp; So I decided to do this show with some general things to consider when making such a personal decision such as purchasing land or anbsp; home.

Tune is Today as I Discuss...

	Remote is a relative term
	Water, got it, don't got it, what's it gonna cost
	The advantages of unimproved and unincorporated land
	Service from a government comes at a cost, which is more valuable to you freedom or "services"
	Who is going with you, you can't be happy if your family is miserable
	Gates, the simple solution to BS excuses like "I was lost, not trespassing"
	The value of good neighbors
	Talk to neighbors BEFORE you buy
	Pick a community you fit into, don't try to change one

		<itunes:summary>OK folks I am back from the Arkansas Bug Out Location from our mini vacation.nbsp; It was great as always and Dorothy and I really had a great opportunity to learn, think and plan for our very near future.nbsp; So today I thought I would share what we experienced with you.

Additionally the house keeping segment was a bit long today but for two reasons.

1.  I wanted to give you a bit more data on the Members Support Brigade.nbsp; Specificly some of the benefits which now include...

	Several e-publications by James T. Stevens
	10% off of everything at Ron Hoods site
	A free lifetime membership to Safe Castle's discount club
	10% off all purchases from Western Botanicals
	Premium videos available only to members

2.  I wanted to let you know that James Stevens new book, "Making the Best of Basics" is available until midnight tonight at the pre launch price of only 29.95 with a free audio CD.nbsp; At midnight the price goes up 5 bucks and no more free CD.nbsp;nbsp; This offer expired last night but since I was late letting everyone know and yesterday's show was pre recorded I talked to James and got a 1 day extension.nbsp; Please note this is not a "marketing tactic", I just wanted to get you guys one last chance to get the free CD and lower price if you are interested in a copy of the book.nbsp; You can get thhe book at this link - Making the Best of Basics

The main topic of today's show is the advantages of country living so tune in today to hear my thoughts on...

	In the country you are surrounded by teachers
	The "freedom to walk" and what that really means
	How people are different and the same
	Why in the country words like silence and noise have new meanings
	Why we seem to be naturally content with less stuff in the country vs the city
	Why we feel less exposed to danger in rural life
	How recreational activities like shooting don't attract the police
	Improvements in mental and physical health when you live in the country
	Why country living isn't for everyone and how some people
	How all of these things are actually directly tied to prepping and self suffiency
	Why preppers value their lives more then the average Joe
	Why most people just don't understand the quest for self suffiency

		<itunes:summary>The number one question I get from non preparedness minded individuals when I tell them about The Survival Podcast is simply, why?

Why takes many forms such as...

	Why do you worry about so many things you can't control?
	Why do I need to do anything different then I am doing now, I got this far OK, right?
	Why should I spend money on things I may never need or even use?
	Why should I sacrifice just to be "debt free" because "you're no one unless you own money in the nation anyway"?
	Why should I store food?
	Why do I need a gun, we have a nice town and a great police force?
	Why do you feel the need to be an alarmist?

Oh and that list of why's goes on and on, I assure you.nbsp; Yet I always answer every single why with the same answer, "because the way I do things my life is better even if nothing bad ever happens".

Tune in today as we discuss this concept and thoughts on how...

	Living debt free is the only way to have the freedom we all desire
	Why most people tolerate things in their life they should never allow
	Why tax is theft and why understanding it creates freedom
	Why no matter what people say you do need to prepare for bad times
	How the media and the government create plastic lifestyles that we choose to live within
	Why storing food will always pay itself back even if you never have to rely on it directly
	Why a garden is liberating and a financial gain
	Why so many people that start to prep fail and fall out and how to change that

		<itunes:summary>After being preempted by the weather yesterday we are doing today's show on listener questions.nbsp; Tune in today as we answer questions about surplus firearms, buying land, keeping and investing in silver, potential bank runs, alcohol as a gas and more.

Today I also tell you about an article I read on Lew Rockwell about coming food shortages and why food producing land will be one of the most valuable commodities in the coming future.  The article is aptly titled "Food Will Never Be So Cheap Again".

		<itunes:summary>You hear it all the time, I want to break free from "The System" or I have to work within "The System" but I am here to tell you "The System" is a myth because there are a multitude of Systems of dependence and each is highly interdependent upon each other.nbsp; You can in principle call these collectively the system but when you do you are missing so many critical elements, vulnerabilities and connections that to do so is pure folly.

Join me today as we discuss the following systems and their interdependence...

	The financial system
	The debt system
	The transportation system
	The distribution systems
	The energy system
	The social order system
	The technological systems
	The non military bureaucracy system
	The military industrial complex
	The system of "societal trust"
	And finally the lesson of learning math with out a calculator and to first shoot with iron sites.

	What is self reliance
	What is self sufficiency
	Why would you want to be self reliant
	Why would you want to be self sufficient
	What are degrees of self sufficiency
	What is healthy interdependence
	Why are concepts like self sufficiency part of our nation at its core
	How much self sufficiency do you want
	How much self reliance do you have, are you deceiving yourself and have you tested yourself
	How have we lost touch with the innate desire for self sufficiency and reliance
	How can you apply these concepts to your daily lifestyle

		<itunes:summary>As we approach the 300th episode I realized it has been a long time since we did a show dedicated to the brand new person.nbsp; Today will will lay out 20 steps to take as a person who has just decided that it is time "to do something" but isn't quite sure what that "something" is.nbsp;nbsp;nbsp; Even though today is done with the new person in mind I think it will help everyone sort of recenter on the core of what is the most important things to make sure you have accomplished.

I have also created a special commercial free version of today's show for sharing with others who you want to get thinking about preparedness.nbsp; That version can be found on our forum here.

Tune in today as we discuss

	Start with the old fable of the grasshopper and the ant
	The first thing you do is assess the situation and stay calm
	Journal your spending and your eating
	Write a plan for debt elimination and begin creating an emergency fund
	Put together a basic documentation package
	Assemble a BOB for each family member (cheap and fast the first time around)
	Inventory your pantry over a week or two (how much food do you have at your low point)
	Begin storing up a 30 day supply of food you will eat anyway
	Begin assembling a low cost 30 day long term storage supply
	Determine where you would go if you had to leave and go at least 50 miles from home
	Make plans for how you would help elderly parents or other family members
	Update your resume and be prepared to loose your job on any given day
	Avoid focusing on any individual coming event or scenario
	Plan a garden and start getting ready to plant (depending on the season)
	Learn about disaster commonality (it is not about the disaster it is about loss of support systems)
	Learn about disaster probability (Personal-Localized-Regional-State-National-Global)
	Determine your most probable "personal", "local" and "regional"
	Start window shopping for "country land" or an "urban homestead"
	Think of the children, won't someone please think of the children (seriously think of your children)
	Assess your "normal preparations"
	Take ownership of your plan and your life

		<itunes:summary>So today we are going to discuss my view of what we can expect from the economy in the next few years and what we can do to prepare for it.nbsp; I will tell you why I think 2010 is actually going to look pretty decent and on the other side why you shouldn't take that much comfor in it.nbsp; Then next week we will take a day to compare my view to the view of many of the experts such as Jim Rodgers and Gerald Celente.

Tune in today to hear...

	Why I think we are about to see a fake recovery followed by a bigger crash
	The stimulus doesn't kick in until 2010, how it will succeed and how it will fail
	Unemployment is "bottoming" the truth and the lies about that statement
	This coming bubble and collapse is planned, I will explain why there is no other option then this one
	Credit cards can't fix a debt problem and how that relates to our national deficit
	How the impact of Health Care won't be seen until late 2011 perhaps longer and the disaster it will create
	The coming 1.5 Trillion Dollar tax increase from thenbsp; administration that promised not to do it
	How high taxes reduce the amount of tax government collects and what it does to the economy
	Why inflation looks like recovery at the beginning
	Why you need to own at least some silver and or gold
	Land is cheap, go make a low ball offer while you can
	Store food, build your own grocery store at home
	Spend smart don't horde money, balance your assets
	Place priority of spending on assets with long term value
	Keep some cash, don't believe the lies about putting all cash into gold right now
	Debt is evil, always in good times and bad
	Never be 100% invested in any item or investment type
	Do not liquidate IRAs and 401ks modify their portfolios but leave the money in the vehicles
	Above all never "freak out", make smart and strategic spending and saving decision you do have time to act,nbsp; don't panic and react to swiftly to concerns

Tune in today as I aswer questions like...

	What to look out for with a 1985 Mil Spec Chevy Blazer or CUCV
	If the government ever choose to try to confiscate firearms how would they most likely do it
	If you own a shot gun and want accessories should you buy them first or invest in ammo
	What do I think of buying 22 long rifle ammo for barter in a SHTF even if you don't own a weapon to use them in
	Do I have any tips for growing tobacco and finding seed stock
	What about a time share as a BOL
	If I bug out what happens to my business and employees
	Why do plants die or taste bitter if planted in "new" compost, what can you do about it
	Will concealed carry training in Michigan allow you to get your permit in Texas (not totally sure on this one and we are not talking about reciprocity carry, tune in for details)
	Do Texans actually drive around with rifles and shotguns in gun racks on a daily basis like the legends say?

		<itunes:summary>In the event of a disaster should you bug in or bug out (shelter in place or evacuate) is a big topic in many forums, email lists and among modern survivalists in general.nbsp; There are times when the question is easy to answer and times when it can be difficult.nbsp; The key is your life and the lives of those you love can hang in the balance of this decision so today we discuss 12 question to ask before you have to make the decision.

Tune in today as we consider the following questions...

	Which choice gives you the best chance of survival for the scenario at hand? (this is not always clear)
	How well prepared are you to bug in?
	What exactly are you prepared for? (a forest fire is far different from local rioting)
	Have evacuation orders been given?
	What is the nature and probable duration of the threat?
	Well staying put change anything as far as "saving your home"?
	Where will you go and how will you get there?
	Do you own a bug out location or have double up plans or no place to go at all?
	Will you be able to help your community if you stay?
	What will the impact of staying or going be on your family, can they handle what you can?
	What can you take with you and what must you leave behind?
	If you leave what exactly is waiting for you at your destination?

The time to answer these questions is not in the middle of a disaster but right now.nbsp; At this point you can plan, form contingencies and be prepared for a variety of outcomes. That way if the day comes your mind is ready to act and you can make the best use of the resources you have.nbsp; As always how you act and how you think is more important then your resources.
